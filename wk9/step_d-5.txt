What you see on the browser (the issue)
---------------------------------------
I can see the html folder, which means that the current directory is one level above that. 

What sensitive information is given by this page
------------------------------------------------
Most importantly, the folder structure and location of web root folder.
The attacker can inject special characters in the query string, exploiting the access to web root folder contents
Injecting JavaScript can possibly result in exposing information in the root folder files
